## 3D Printed Case

I've had a first pass at designing a 3D printed case for the PICO-56. The PCB wasn't really designed with a case in mind, so there are some compromises. Primarily, it doesn't screw together. It clips together.

### Print details

* 0.2mm layer height
* Supports to bed only
* Top and base printed with flat surface down
* Buttons printed on their sides with supports and raised 0.2mm
* Badge printed with a pause for filament swap
* Photos from Creality Ender 3 V3 KE using 1.75mm Creality Hyper Series PLA

### Threaded inserts

The threaded inserts I've used are M3.5x5.7x4.6
